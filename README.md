# Marketing-Case-Study

# Case Study Context

* An online travel agency wants to improve the hotel-booking experience by making it mobile-friendly and as
easy as chatting with a friend. 

* Some of the ways that they advertise the hotel rooms is through common hotel booking sites that aggregate rates from many OTAâ€™s. 
* They are able to determine how much they would  like to spend on each click. 
* They can set a different spend per click for each itinerary (itinerary is the unique inputs of the search: hotel / length of stay / checkin date / etc...).
* If they spend more, they will be more likely to be shown and will appear higher in the ranking. 
* If they spend less, they will be shown lower in the ranking but if our bid is too low, they may not be shown
at all.

# Key Deliverables of the Case Study

* Identify key trends from booking and spending data
* How can the OTA agency improve?
